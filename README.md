# Justice-Without-Fear
Justice Without Fear empowers victims of police brutality and wrongful use-of-force. We provide essential rights education, survivor resources, and a roadmap for legal accountability. Our mission is to ensure no family navigates the aftermath of tragedy alone. Together, we move from crisis to empowerment. Justice is a right, not a risk.
